GP Structure Search for Classification
=========================================

Run runExperiments.m and follow execution to see how the code works. structureSearch.m dictates the flow of the search procedure. 

There are versions of individual kernel evaluations that run both on the local machine or remotely, on the fear cluster. The cluster procedure will have to be modified for each user to be able to communicate remotely - this hasn't been used for a year so might have become obsolete. 

Feel free to email me with any questions at (nm480@cam.ac.uk). 

Branching: for any changes that you would like to commit, please use a separate branch, and contact me before merging into master.
